This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript bug related to type coercion. TypeScript's flexibility, while beneficial, can sometimes lead to unexpected runtime errors if not handled carefully.  The `bug.ts` file showcases how a string can be passed to a function expecting a number, resulting in a silent compilation but a runtime failure. The solution file, `bugSolution.ts`, offers several ways to prevent this issue, improving code robustness and catching type errors earlier in the development process.
